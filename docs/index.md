TTN - Architecture Specifications
=================================

## Foreword

This document hereby refers to the content of the whole website. Any contributors is welcomed
and could give a hand in several manners:

- Looking for and correcting typos
- Add relevant and non redundant information
- Complete a part marked as //TODO

**Regardless of what you'll attempt, make sure to check [the issues list on
GitHub][github_issues] before doing anything**. Thus, if nobody is already working on something
related, open an issue with a clear and concise title and briefly explain your incoming changes
in the description. Then, fork the project, do your work, and create a Pull Request on the
original repository. 

To sum up:

- Check [GitHub issues][github_issues]
- Open a new issue if no one exist
- Fork the repository
- Create a Pull Request once you're done

## Overview

The following document describe the specifications for The Things Network's Architecture
version 1. These specifications focus on the network architecture which includes 4 kind of
components:

- Routers 
- Brokers
- Network Servers
- Handlers

Incidentally, those components are interacting with other external entities on which we have -
if any - only few control :

- Nodes (also known as end-devices)
- Gateways
- Applications

## Node
Nodes or end-devices refer to one end of the chain. Devices emit signals using
[*LoRa*][lora_technology] modulation and frequency range towards Gateways. They are split into
3 classes: 

- **A**: Cannot receive any data from the network unless they've initiated the communication
- **B**: Can receive data from the network at precisely scheduled windows (Beacons)
- **C**: Can receive data at any time from the network

Incidentally, class A requires less power than B which requires less power than C. 
An end-device has an address either assigned by the Network or self-defined. An end-device
also has a specific secret application session key and a network session key 

These specifications primarly focus on the class A. Future network versions will implement
mechanisms to handle class B and class C but they are irrevelant with the current document.

## Gateway
Gateways might be seen as a way to transform multiple messages emitters into one much more
demanding emitter. Therefore, a Gateway gathers [*LoRa*][lora_technology] signals coming from a
bunch of near end-devices. A given device does not need to know the nearest gateways, nor it
has to communicate with a specific one - signals are simply broadcasted into the wild open. 

Gateways receive signals which reach them, and forward the message to a dedicated Router. The
Data could be either a sensor result or a specific network command such as a connection
request. A Gateway actually send incoming packets to a router, one-by-one, and after having
wrapped each of them into a [json][json] structure holding meta-data about the Gateway itself (such as
Gateway's address, a timestamp and GPS coordinates if available).

Gateways can also emit packets coming from the network toward a Node using the [*LoRa
technology*][lora_technology]. In fact, Gateways are in charge of taking care of emission at a
scheduled time defined by the network meaning that the network is able to send packets to
Gateways at any moment, regardless of their emission time (see more about the two-windows
response mechanism //TODO add a link). 

## Application

## Router

Routers are entry points of the network from Nodes perspective. A Router receives packets
gathered by some Gateways and initially transmitted by Nodes. Then, it forwards those packets
to one or several Brokers. The communication is seemingly bi-directional: Routers may also
transfer packets from Broker to Gateways.

## Broker

Brokers have a global vision of a network's part. They are in charge of several nodes, meaning
that they will handle packets coming from those nodes (thereby, they are able to tell to
Routers if they can handle a given packet). Several Routers may send packets coming from the
same end-device (shared by several segments / Gateways), all duplicates are managed by the
Broker and are sent to a corresponding Handler.

A Broker is thereby able to check the integrity of a packet and is closely communicating with a
Network Server in order to administrate the related device. As an order of magnitude, Brokers
are designed to be in charge of a whole country or region (if the region has enough activity to
deserve a dedicated Broker).

## Network Server

Network servers are processing [MAC][mac] commands emitted by end-devices as well as taking care
of the data rates and the frequency of the devices. Network Servers would emit commands to
optimize the network by adjusting end-devices data rates / frequencies unless the node is
requesting to keep its configuration as is. 

For the moment, a single Network Server will be associated for each Broker. No communication
mechanisms between Network Servers is planned for the first version. Also, it won't be possible
for a Broker to query another Network Server than the one it has been assigned to. Those
features might be part of a second version. 

## Handler

Handlers materialize the entry point to the network for client Applications. They are secure
referees which encode and decode data coming from application before transmitting them to a
Broker of the network. Therefore, they are in charge of handling applications secret keys and
only communicate an application id to Brokers (as well as a specific network session key,
described in further sections). This way, the whole chain is able to forward a packet to the
corresponding Handler without having any information about either the recipient (but a
meaningless id) or the content. 

Because a given Handler is able to decrypt the data payload of a given packet, it could
also implement mechanisms such as Geolocation and send to the corresponding application some
interesting meta-data.

An Handler could be either part of an application or a standalone trusty server on which
application may register. The Things Network will provide Handlers as part of the whole network
but - and this is true for any component - anyone could create its own implementation as long
as it is compliant to the following specifications.
