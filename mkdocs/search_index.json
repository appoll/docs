These specifications focus on the network architecture which includes 4 kinds of\ncomponents:\n\n\n\n\nRouters \n\n\nBrokers\n\n\nNetwork Servers\n\n\nHandlers\n\n\n\n\nIncidentally, those components are interacting with other external entities on which we have -\nif any - only few controls:\n\n\n\n\nNodes (also known as end-devices)\n\n\nGateways\n\n\nApplications\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNetwork components\n\n\n\n\nNode\n\n\nNodes or end-devices refer to one end of the chain. Devices emit signals using\n\nLoRa\n modulation and frequency range towards Gateways. They are split into\n3 classes: \n\n\n\n\nA\n: Cannot receive any data from the network unless they've initiated the communication\n\n\nB\n: Can receive data from the network at precisely scheduled windows (Beacons)\n\n\nC\n: Can receive data at any time from the network\n\n\n\n\nIncidentally, class A requires less power than B which requires less power than C. \nAn end-device has an address either assigned by the Network or self-defined. An end-device\nalso has a specific secret application session key and a network session key \n\n\nThese specifications primarly focus on the class A. Future network versions will implement\nmechanisms to handle class B and class C but they are irrevelant with the current document.\n\n\nGateway\n\n\nGateways might be seen as a way to transform multiple messages emitters into one much more\ndemanding emitter. Therefore, a Gateway gathers \nLoRa\n signals coming from a\nbunch of near end-devices. A given device does not need to know the nearest gateways, nor it\nhas to communicate with a specific one - signals are simply broadcasted into the wild open. \n\n\nGateways receive signals which reach them, and forward the message to a dedicated Router. The\nData could be either a sensor result or a specific network command such as a connection\nrequest. A Gateway actually send incoming packets to a router after having wrapped each of them\ninto a \njson\n structure holding meta-data about the Gateway itself (such as Gateway's\nidentifier, a timestamp and GPS coordinates if available).\n\n\nGateways can also emit packets coming from the network toward a Node using the \nLoRa\ntechnology\n. In fact, Gateways are in charge of taking care of emission at a\nscheduled time defined by the network meaning that the network is able to send packets to\nGateways at any moment, regardless of their emission time (see more about the two-windows\nresponse mechanism //TODO add a link). \n\n\nApplication\n\n\nRouter\n\n\nRouters are entry points of the network from Nodes perspective. A Router receives packets\ngathered by some Gateways and initially transmitted by Nodes. Then, it forwards those packets\nto one or several Brokers. The communication is seemingly bi-directional: Routers may also\ntransfer packets from Broker to Gateways. \n\n\n\n\n\n\nUplink forwarding\n\n\n\n\nBroker\n\n\nBrokers have a global vision of a network's part. They are in charge of several nodes, meaning\nthat they will handle packets coming from those nodes (thereby, they are able to tell to\nRouters if they can handle a given packet). Several Routers may send packets coming from the\nsame end-device (shared by several segments / Gateways), all duplicates are managed by the\nBroker and are sent to a corresponding Handler.\n\n\nA Broker is thereby able to check the integrity of a packet and is closely communicating with a\nNetwork Server in order to administrate the related device. As an order of magnitude, Brokers\nare designed to be in charge of a whole country or region (if the region has enough activity to\ndeserve a dedicated Broker).\n\n\nNetwork Server\n\n\nNetwork servers are processing \nMAC\n commands emitted by end-devices as well as taking care\nof the data rates and the frequency of the devices. Network Servers would emit commands to\noptimize the network by adjusting end-devices data rates / frequencies unless the node is\nrequesting to keep its configuration as is. \n\n\nFor the moment, a single Network Server will be associated for each Broker. No communication\nmechanisms between Network Servers is planned for the first version. Also, it won't be possible\nfor a Broker to query another Network Server than the one it has been assigned to. Those\nfeatures might be part of a second version. \n\n\nHandler\n\n\nHandlers materialize the entry point to the network for client Applications. They are secure\nreferees which encode and decode data coming from application before transmitting them to a\nBroker of the network. Therefore, they are in charge of handling applications secret keys and\nonly communicate an application id to Brokers (as well as a specific network session key,\ndescribed in further sections). This way, the whole chain is able to forward a packet to the\ncorresponding Handler without having any information about either the recipient (but a\nmeaningless id) or the content. \n\n\nBecause a given Handler is able to decrypt the data payload of a given packet, it could\nalso implement mechanisms such as Geolocation and send to the corresponding application some\ninteresting meta-data.\n\n\nA Handler could be either part of an application or a standalone trusty server on which\napplication may register. The Things Network will provide Handlers as part of the whole network\nbut - and this is true for any component - anyone could create its own implementation as long\nas it is compliant to the following specifications.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nUplink to an Application",

The emitter and the recipient could be either:\n\n\n\n\nA gateway and a broker\n\n\nA broker and a gateway\n\n\n\n\nThis implies the router is able to interact with gateways and brokers in a bi-directional\nway. Let's distinguish communications the following way:\n\n\n\n\nUplink communication (from a gateway to one or several brokers)\n\n\nDownlink communication (from a broker to a gateway)\n\n\n\n\nCommunications protocols used between, on the one hand, gateways and the router (uplink) and,\non the other hand, the router and brokers (downlink) don't have to be identical. \n\n\nBoth communication processes have their own characteristics and behavior, they will be detailed\nseparately. \n\n\nUplink communication\n\n\nA given gateway will be connected to a router of its choice, meaning that the gateway is\nconfigured to interact with that precise router (a gateway could be configured for several\nrouters, but the idea is the same; they are not allowed dynamically and won't change as long as\nthe configuration remains the same). Obviously, a router might received communications from\nseveral gateways as well. Thus, gateways are completely unknown from a router - and would\nremain unknown during the router lifecycle.\n\n\nA router is thereby a machine on which gateway will attempt to connect. This assumes that the\nrouter is accessible via a static IP address or solvable through a DNS service. The whole\nprotocol used by gateways can be found \nhere\n and could be sum up as follow:\n\n\n\n\nGateways initiate communication with a router\n\n\nGateways send data using a json structure and containing one or several packets\n\n\nThe router acknowledge reception of data\n\n\nGateways could be protected by a firewall or could use a NAT, routers cannot initiate communications\n\n\nGateways might trigger and pull the router periodically to keep a connexion open (this is\n  fairly an implementation detail, but the gateway protocol we are refering to is describing an\n  implementation. We'll see how we handle this in the next section)\n\n\nThe communication is closed after a delay (after the second receive window, cf. downlink\n  communication)\n\n\n\n\nDownlink communication\n\n\nBecause of the first version, the network will only supports devices of class A, the connexion\nbetween a gateway and a router would stay opened for a maximum of 2 seconds. The whole process\nis detailed in the \nLoRaWAN specifications 1.0\n - section 3.3 Receive Windows. In few\nwords though, after having emitted messages, a class A node will open two short receive windows\nand will allow incoming messages from a gateway. Windows are opened exactly one and two seconds\nafter the packet's emission. Sending packet at the right time is part of the gateway\nresponsibility, however, scheduling the emission is part of the network's one. \n\n\nIf any command or data have to be sent to the node, it has to be done precisely during one of\nthis two windows. More details about commands are given in the section related to the\nNetwork Server. Incidentally, only one of the two windows is available, meaning that sending\nthrough the first window will cause the second one to never be opened. \n\n\n\n\n\n\nReceive Windows\n\n\n\n\nHaving said that, a downlink communication could be initiated by either an Application or a\nNetwork Server in response of an uplink message from a device. The role of a router is to\nforward those messages, not to trigger or schedule them.\n\n\nDecoupling\n\n\nIn order to communicate with the outside world, we'll split the router in three parts: \n\n\n\n\nThe core router\n\n\nAn uplink adapter\n\n\nA downlink adapter\n\n\n\n\nThe idea is to avoid to tightly couple the router core features with the way it is\ncommunicating. By doing such a separation of concerns, we allow the router to evolve and change\nits communication protocol at any moment, without any impact on the core mechanisms. Thus, as\nlong as the adapters remain compliant to a given interface they can be switched on demand. \n\n\nAll three components will share a common representation of a packet tagged with a version\nnumber. As long as all component use compatible representation of a packet, they sould be able\nto communicate. \n\n\nPackets are \njson\n structure with the following structure:\n\n\n{\n    \ntime\n: \nString\n,\n    \ntmst\n: \nNumber\n,\n    \nfreq\n: \nNumber\n,\n    \nchan\n: \nNumber\n,\n    \nrfch\n: \nNumber\n,\n    \nstat\n: \nNumber\n,\n    \nmodu\n: \nString\n,\n    \ndatr\n: \nNumber\n, // In case of GFSK modulation\n    \ndatr\n: \nString\n, // In case of LoRa modulation\n    \ncodr\n: \nString\n,\n    \nrssi\n: \nNumber\n,\n    \nlsnr\n: \nNumber\n,\n    \nsize\n: \nNumber\n,\n    \ndata\n: \nString\n\n}\n\n\n\n\nMore information about the meaning of those fields could be found in the \nsemtech protocol\ndescription\n.\n\n\nUplink adapter\n\n\nWe consider the following methods for the Uplink adapter (hereby known as \nUpAdapter\n):\n\n\n-- Notify the gateway that the given packet has been received\nack :: UpAdapter, Packet -\n Unit\nack (adapter, packet)\n\n-- Send a downlink packet to a gateway\nforward :: UpAdapter, Packet -\n Unit\nforward (adapter, packet)\n\n\n\n\nThe uplink adapter is thereby in charge of queuing incoming packets, and trigger the router to\nhandle them properly. Because data coming from a gateway aren't formatted in the right way and\nalso because a gateway might send several packets through the same message, it is under the\nuplink adapter responsability to decode and interpret the data accordingly. \n\n\nDownlink adapter\n\n\nWe consider the following methods for the Downlink adapter (hereby known as \nDownAdapter\n):\n\n\n-- Send a packet to every available brokers. This method should trigger \n-- back some calls on the router to inform the router about which Broker \n-- are indeed responsible for the Packet.\nbroadcast :: DownAdapter, Packet -\n Unit\nbroadcast (adapter, packet)\n\n-- Forward an uplink packet to a list of brokers using their addresses\nforward :: DownAdapter, BrokerAddr[], Packet -\n Unit\nforward (adapter, [broAddr1, broAddr2], packet)\n\n\n\n\nThe downlink adapter should implement mechanism to handle network discovering (\nbroadcast\n).\nBasically, this will be done when there is no known broker for a given packet. The downlink\nadapter is thereby in charge of registering device addresses to the core router once brokers\nhave been discovered. \n\n\nCore\n\n\nThe core router (hereby known as \nRouter\n) handle all the router logic. It also supplies a\nconcise interface to allow both adapters to trigger actions. Any error or success from both\nadapters could trigger one of the following method.\n\n\n-- Ask the router to handle a specific error. \nhandleError :: Router, Error -\n Unit\nhandleError (router, err)\n\n-- Handle an incoming uplink packet\nhandleUplink :: Router, Packet -\n Unit\nhandleUplink (router, packet)\n\n-- Handle an incoming downlink packet\nhandleDownlink :: Router, Packet -\n Unit\nhandleDownlink (router, packet)\n\n-- Register a bunch of brokers address for a given device\nregisterDevice :: Router, DeviceAddr, BrokerAddr[] -\n Unit\nregisterDevice (router, devAddr, [broAddr1, broAddr2])\n\n\n\n\nThe \nhandleError\n method gives adapters a way to notify the router of an unresolved transaction\nor an incorrect behavior from the network. Errors are detailed below and should be explicit\nenough to allow the router to recover from it. \n\n\nErrors\n\n\nAny error coming from any router's components should provide the following information:\n\n\n\n\na name / identifier \n\n\na date (the moment it happens)\n\n\na message / description\n\n\nthe packet or data manipulated if any\n\n\n\n\nA given error will thus provide methods that reflect those attributes:\n\n\n-- Retrieve the error's name\nname :: Error -\n String\nname (err)\n\n-- Retrieve the error's creation date\ndate :: Error -\n Date|String\ndate (err) \n\n-- Retrieve the error's message\nmessage :: Error -\n String\nmessage (err)\n\n-- Retrieve the error's data\nparams :: Error -\n a\nparams (err)\n\n\n\n\nErrors types the router may encounter are listed right below. This list isn't settled and is\nlikely to grow during the development. However, it gives an overview of referenced errors.
